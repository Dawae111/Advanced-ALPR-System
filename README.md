# Advanced Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System

## Overview
This project develops an advanced Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system using deep learning techniques to efficiently and accurately detect and interpret vehicle license plates in real-time. The system is designed to work under various environmental conditions and can be integrated into modern traffic management solutions.

## Features
- Real-time detection and recognition of license plates from video feeds.
- High accuracy under different lighting and weather conditions.
- (API for easy integration into existing traffic management systems.) can be considered

## Technologies
- Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Image Processing: OpenCV

## Performance
The system achieves xx% accuracy in plate detection and xx% in character recognition under controlled test conditions.
